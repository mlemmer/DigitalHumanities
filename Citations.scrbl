See @secref["Bibliography" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/scribble/scribble.scrbl")] in the @hyperlink["file:///usr/share/doc/racket/scribble/Bibliography.html"]{Scribble Guide}

The formatting for the bibliography in scribble may look intimidating, but really you are filling in the same general fields you would in any citation manager. This feature requires access to the @racket{scriblib/autobib} library, so include that in the list of required libraries at the top of your page. Citations use keyword arguments (@racket[#:title], @racket[#:url], etc) that allow you to construct your citation with the components you need. For ease of data entry, you can just copy and paste the from the templates below for each citation. However, if you do so remember to @bold{remove any keyword-arguments you do not use} because a blank argument will result in an error message.

@bold{Basic components of a citation:}

@codeblock|{@(define bib-Example2018
   (make-bib
    #:title     "Example Book Title"
    #:author    (authors "Author One" "Author Two")
    #:is-book?  yes
    #:date      2018
    #:location (book-location #:publisher "City:Publisher")
    #:url      "exampleurl.com"
    #:note     "This is where you would annotate your citation"))}|

this is a nuts and bolts example of a citation entry with the types of information required in each field. I will now go through and cut that entry into pieces to explain each of the components you need to create your bibliography. Following that I will provide a template and examples of the main types of bibliographic entry.

@codeblock|{(require scriblib/autobib)}| 

Your bibliography will draw on the @racket{scriblib library}, so it is necessary to include it in the libraries called at the top of your page.

@codeblock|{@(define-cite ~cite citet-id generate-bibliography #:style author+date-style)}|

@(define-cite ~cite citet generate-bibliography #:style author+date-style)

This function is what allows scribble to place citations in-line in your document and generate a bibliography from those citations. It also determines what type of citations you will have using the keyword-argument @literal|{#:style }|. Out of the box, scribble only has two citation options: author+date-style (Flatt and PLT 2010) and number-style@~cite[bib-Flatt2010]. However, you can use a BibTeX file to modify the laTeX output to any citation style you want. You only need to define this function once for the whole bibliography.

@codeblock|{define bib-NameDate
            (make-bib
                     )}|

This has two components. You are essentially defining a new function for each citation. You can use whatever naming convention you want but for your own sanity, stay consistent. For this tutorial, I'm defining each citation with the prefix bib- and the author(s) last name and the date (bib-Barber1994). The second component (make-bib) is what defines this function as a citation.

@codeblock|{#:title "Title of Book Here"}|

This section is for the title of the book or article. This argument requires a string, so place the title in quotation marks. This can lead to some formatting problems when quotation marks are used in the code @italic{and} you are creating an entry for an article and the title needs to be in parentheses. Some BibTeX styles may automatically fix this. If not, use a method called string escaping by typing forward-slash before the set of quotation marks you wish to be visible (@literal|{"This is a string." "\"The Evolution of String Theory\""}|

@codeblock|{#:author (authors "Author One" "Author Two")}|

Since there can be multiple authors, this argument requires a list of strings. Place the author(s) name(s) in quotation marks within the parentheses after authors. If there are multiple authors, leave only a space between the two strings (authors "Carole Gillis" "Marie-Louise Nosch"). The program recognizes the structure of "firstname lastname" in these strings and separates them automatically for whatever citation format you use. If the author name does not fit in this format, use @literal|{@literal}| instead of parentheses. Ex: @literal|{(authors @literal|{Cato the Elder}|), (authors @literal|{Kelsey Museum of Archaeology}|)}|

@codeblock|{#:date "2018"}|

This argument requires a string, so place the date in quotation marks. 

@codeblock|{#:is-book? "yes"}|

This argument italicizes the title component of the citation (as opposed to journal articles, sections of books, or tech reports). @bold{Only use this argument if the answer is yes}. This argument requires a string, so place yes in quotation marks.

@codeblock|{#:url "exampleurl.com"}|

This argument takes a string, place the url in quotation marks.

@codeblock|{#:note "This book was really useful..."}|

You can annotate your bibliography with this argument. While most of the strings we've used so far are short, in this context your string can be as long as a paragraph.

@codeblock|{#:location (citation keyword [])}|

The location field is where you distinguish between citation types. Below are citation types and the additional keyword-arguments that each takes in the location portion of the above template. 

@subsection{Book}

@codeblock|{#:location (book-location #:edition #:publisher )}|

Both of these arguments require strings. For publisher, enter both fields "city: publisher". When a keyword-argument takes multiple subsequent arguments, you can either place them in-line with a single space between as shown here, or return once between arguments.

Template:

@codeblock|{
@(define bib-NameDate
   (make-bib
    #:title
    #:author (authors )
    #:is-book?
    #:date
    #:location (book-location #:edition #:publisher )
    #:url
    #:note ))}|

Example (single author):

@codeblock|{
@(define bib-Barber1994
   (make-bib
    #:title "Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years: Women, Cloth, and Society
in Early Times."

    #:is-book? "yes"
    #:date "1994"
    #:location (book-location #:publisher "New York: Norton")
    #:note "In this seminal book, Barber looks at the association between
women and textile production spanning the time period from 20,000-
500 BCE in various cultures in the Mediterranean, Egypt, and Near East. 
While Barber does not cover Roman evidence, this book is a foundational 
resource for how to approach the topic of textile production as a gendered
task."))}|

@(define bib-Barber1994
   (make-bib

@subsection{Journal Article}

@codeblock|{#:location (journal-location "JournalTitle" 
                        #:pages #:number #:volume)}|

The journal-location argument automatically takes an argument of the title of the journal as a string. The pages argument requires a numerical range in the form of a list. Create this by putting the two numbers in parentheses separated by a single space and place a single quote before the parentheses @literal|{'(1 10)}|

Template:

    #:note      "In this brief article, Cottica summarizes the association between women and spinning in the Greek and Roman cultures. She approaches the topic thematically, covering religious associations, everyday life, and funerary topics."))

@subsection{Conference Proceedings}

@codeblock|{#:location (proceedings-location "ProceedingsTitle" #:pages #:number #:volume)}|

This format can be used for conference proceedings or for chapters or sections of books. The proceedings-location argument automatically takes an argument of the title of the proceedings/book as a string. The pages argument requires a numerical range in the form of a list. Create this by putting the two numbers in parentheses separated by a single space and place a single quote before the parentheses @literal|{'(1 10)}|

Template:

@codeblock|{
@(define bib-NameDate
   (make-bib
    #:title

@subsection{Dissertation/Thesis}

@codeblock|{#:location (dissertation-location #:institution #:degree)}|

Both of these arguments require strings, enter the answers in quotation marks.

Template:

@codeblock|{
@(define bib-NameDate

If you are following along and testing this as you go, you've now got several functions defined for specific citations. However, if you were to export these citations to either html or pdf, nothing would appear because so far we've created only the back end. Just like most citation management programs, two more steps are required before you get any output. You must cite the source in your text, then you must generate the bibliography.

Use @literal|{@~cite[bib-NameDate]}| to enter your citations in-line of your text. These will either be author+date-style or number-style depending on which option you determined above. Use @literal|{@(generate-bibliography)}| to create the full bibliography based on sources you've cited in your text. For this example, I'm just using the citation and bibliography styles that come out of the box with scribble. You can change the citation style and formatting with LaTeX.

@section{Footnotes}
See @secref["footnotes" #:doc '(lib "scriblib/scribblings/scriblib.scrbl")] in the @hyperlink["file:///usr/share/doc/racket/scriblib/footnotes.html"]{Scribble Guide}

@racket{(require scriblib/footnote)}

Your bibliography will draw on the @racket{scriblib/footnote} library, so it is necessary to include it in the libraries called at the top of your page. There is a built-in note function, @literal|{@note}|.@note{You'll notice that in the html this appears on the side and is unnumbered, in the pdf it is a numbered footnote} In your html output, notes made using this function appear to the side of the text. In the pdf output, they appear as footnotes.

If you want your footnotes to appear as endnotes in the html output, you must define the footnote function using @literal|{@define-footnote}|. This requires two arguments separated by a space --- the first is the tag you will use to place a footnote in-line of your text, the second is the tag you will use to generate your footnotes. You can use whatever naming convention you want. For this tutorial, I’m keeping it simple and using 'footnote' and 'make-footnote'. 

@codeblock|{@define-footnote[footnote make-footnote]}|
@define-footnote[footnote make-footnote]

You then will call your footnotes by typing @literal|{@footnote{Whatever text you want in your footnote}| in-line of your text. Other than html output, @literal|{@note and @footnote}| are now interchangeable. If you use both --- as I have here --- The numbers will sync up in the pdf footnotes even.

You can nest footnotes and citations by typing @literal|{@footnote{@~cite[bib-NameDate]}}|. If you have multiple citations in one footnote, you simply call each citation: @literal|{@footnote{@~cite[bib-NameDate1]; @~cite[bib-NameDate2]}}|. You can also combine both text and a citation in a footnote: @literal|{@footnote{A similar representation can be found in @~cite[bib-NameDate]}}|.
